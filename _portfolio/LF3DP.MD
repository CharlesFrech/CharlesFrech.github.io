# Features/Design Elements

* **Custom Parts** Many custom parts were designed to hold syringes of different sizes. 
Firstly, three mounts were designed to hold the body, the plunger, and the syringe tip. These components were dimensioned with respect to a large 20 mL with zero tolerance to provide a tight fit that would eliminate any chance of wobbling and rotating in the yaw or pitch direction. A modular mounting system allowed the 20 mL and 10 mL syringes to fit on the device by combining longer brackets in the middle and end supports. Furthermore, a end support was used to limit the carriages motion and prevent it from interfering with the flexible coupler. To protect model's electronics form water and finger intrusion, the device also has an electronic enflosure. The model’s enclosure has minimal extrusions, so a leaky syringe will not damage the device’s hardware. The design is also boxed and precisely dimensioned to be large enough for the breadboard, Arduino, power supply box, and all the wiring. Finally, a motor mount was design to attacha a NEMA 17 stepper motor to the device. All of these custom parts were designed in Fushion 360. The syringe mounts, electronic enclosure, and end supports were subsequently printed out of PLA using fused filament fabrication. The motor mounting plate was printed out of ABS because of its ability to resist significant softening as a result of the heat generated by the motor. 
* **Electrical Components** The syringe pump contains one latching push button, two non-latching push buttons, one multicolored LED, and one limit switch. One of the buttons is a push button, which stops and starts the motion of the stepper motor depending on whether it is in a high or low state (pressed or unpressed). When the latching push button is pressed, the LED becomes green, and the motion occurs. When the latching push button is unpressed, the LED becomes yellow, and the motion halts. Another method to control the motion of the motor is the limit switch. When the syringe is fully emptied, the carriage presses the limit switch. When this occurs, the motion of the motor stops, and the LED turns red. Another control mechanism implemented for the motion of the syringe pump utilized the two non-latching push buttons. When the left push button is held in the pressed position, the syringe moves back to a starting position so that new fluid can be put into the syringe. When the right push button is held in the pressed position, the syringe is emptied at a constant rate. 
* **Programming** The syringe is programmed using the Arduino IDE. The program begins by initializing variables for the motor, flow rate, speed, syringe diameter, lead screw pitch, button inputs (including the limit switch), and LED inputs. The setup function receives a max speed, sets the speed based on the flow rate, and defines the pin more for the buttons and LEDs. In the loop of the function, the base color values of the LED are preset to be zero so that they can be updated later. Then, the start/stop button is checked. If  the button is pressed, then the speed is set using the convert flow to speed function, and the LED is changed to green. If the button is not pressed, the speed will be set to 0, and the LED values will update to a yellow color to signify that the motor is paused. Next, the program checks if the counterclockwise button is pressed; if so, the speed is set to -50 so that the syringe moves backwards. Then, the limit switch is checked. If the limit switch is pressed, the speed is set to 0, and the LED values are assigned to red color values. The limit switch is checked after the counterclockwise button so the syringe can move backwards even if the limit switch is pressed. Then, if the clockwise button is pressed, the speed is set to a constant 50. This button is checked after the limit switch so the carriage will not run into the other components. Lastly, the final LED values are written to the LED pins, and the run speeds are set in the stepper to move the motor. An additional function to convert the flow rate to speed uses an equation for the global speed variable. This function is called in the loop.

# Instructions for Operation

To operate the pump, the user must first load the syringe. The outward extrusions (the holders 
designed for human fingers) should fit into the middle support. The tip of the syringe should be rested on the end support, facing away from the motor. Finally, the end part of the plunger should be placed in the  extrusion located at the top of the carriage. Then, the person operating this device may plug it in to turn it  on. The user can then press the latching button, which serves as a start/stop button, to start the syringe pump. The LED will turn green, and the device will begin dispensing liquid. If the user presses the latching button again, the motor will stop moving, and the LED will turn yellow. Finally, when the carriage holding the syringe hits the limit switch on the middle mount, the motor stops, and the LED turns red. This outcome occurs when the syringe is empty. The design also contains two additional buttons that change the direction of the motor’s rotation. Because the motor can rotate clockwise and counterclockwise, the syringe can fill and expel liquids using these buttons at a constant rate. A user operates this multi-directional pump feature by simply holding one of the two buttons (whichever one is linked to the desired motion).
